# jqSelector

This librariy helps to generate awesome
jQuery selectors from DOM elements.

It can create a single selector for one specified element,
or produce a selector for a list of DOM elements.

## Requirements

For development it's recommended to have the following nodejs tools
installed globally (npm install -g)

* coffee-script (for cake)
* jade (templating engine)
* docco (for documentation generation)

## Howto use/develop this

Use the cake, Luke. You can `cake docs` and `cake tests`.
The tests end up as an index.html in `tests/html`, the 
documentation in `docs/*`.
